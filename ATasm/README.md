# Atari800 dev - ATasm

This workspace is mainly based on `cerebus.atasm-altirra-bridge` plugin. 

For running altirra emulator I recommend installing it under WINE and changing appropriate paths in `./tools/run_altirra_wine.sh`, or defining `altirra` alias. This file should have execute permissions.

To change file being compiled modify `atasm-build.json` file - precisely the `input` field.
