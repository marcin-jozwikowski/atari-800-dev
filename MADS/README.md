# Atari800 dev - MADS

## Instructions

Write your code in `.asm` file and issue a `build` command (`Ctrl+Shift+B` by default). Choose `build` or `build and run` to issue appropriate action.

## Extensions

`mirao.mads` is recommended for MADS syntax highlighting.

## Emulation

Only `altirra` is being used with `atari800` as a fallback. No debuging capabilities yet (besides those built into the emulators).
